# Blinkit-Grocery-Sales-Performance-Dashboard

I’m excited to share my latest project, where I analyzed Blinkit Grocery Data and created this dashboard in Excel. My goal was to make the data easy to understand and accessible for everyone.

🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboard:

✅ Total Sales: Blinkit achieved impressive sales of $1.20M.
✅ Top-Selling Items: Fruits & Vegetables lead with $178.12K in revenue.
✅ Top Locations: Tier 3 cities contributed the highest sales with $472.13K.
✅ Customer Choices: Regular-fat products dominate, accounting for 65% of total sales.

🎯 Why I Chose Excel:

Excel is simple and widely used, so anyone can easily understand the data.
Future updates or changes to the dashboard can be done quickly and easily.
Dynamic filters and clear visuals (like charts and graphs) make the insights actionable.

💻 As a Data Analyst, I believe in making data accessible and meaningful for everyone. This project reflects my commitment to creating user-friendly solutions.
